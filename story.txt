There is a little bug flying in the sky. This is a tiny small bug that no one is able to find it. It likes to trick people who are always trying to find it.

Ty, a college student who just took 5 midterms in 2 days, walks into the room.
He opens the freezer and takes out a tub of mint ice cream. As soon as he takes the first bite, he feels a tiny crunch.


Ty looks down and sees a little bug. He is horrified that he could commit such a heinous act. He believes that reporting himself to the police for 
fly-slaughter is too extreme. He, is however, determined to find the fly's family and let them know, and he wants to take care of them.

First however, he finishes the ice cream.

After that, he feel sleepy and forget to find the bug's family. Consequently or not, he get a 23/33 in his p1 for CS400

Fin.
